    "Notes": "Made a starter of 1L water & 85g Light DME about 24hours ahead of time and put it on a stir plate.  Started with 4 gallons and steeped grains until 160degF and then left it at 160-165degF for 30 minutes. At the end of that time the gravity was 1.017 at probably 3.6 gallons (grain took out water).  Took off heat to add extract and then brought to a boil at about 206degF.  Let it boil for 15 minutes before starting hop additions.  Ended up putting about 3.4 gallons in the fermenter at a gravity of 1.082.  I added approximately 6qts of water to bring it up to almost 5 gallons and a OG of 1.053.  The yeast added about a liter (or 1 quart) of volume as well (but the OG was measured before this addition).",
